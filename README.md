# asistente-clima
A simple script that shows a notification assistant with the weather of a city aloud. (You need an API key, verify your account, and enter the city and country in the code for the location you want the weather for.)

This is a Python script. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed to run it.
⚠️ Platform Compatibility

Designed to work on Linux systems only, as it uses the notify-send command to display desktop notifications.
It may not work properly on Windows or macOS without modifications.

1. Clone this repository
2. Replace your city and country, and the API key in main.py.
3. Run the script.
